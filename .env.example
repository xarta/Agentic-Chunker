# Agentic Chunker — Example Client Configuration
# ================================================
# Copy this to .env for local tool usage.
# The .env file is gitignored — do not commit it.
#
# This configures the CLIENT-SIDE tools (health checks, test requests).
# The SERVER-SIDE config (VLLM endpoints, API keys) lives in the
# stack's environment, injected at deploy time.

# Deployed service endpoint
